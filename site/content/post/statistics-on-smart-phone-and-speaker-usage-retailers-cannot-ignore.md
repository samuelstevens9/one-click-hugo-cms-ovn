The question of [AI-voice](https://openvoicenetwork.org/post/announcing-the-open-voice-initiative/) in commerce is not whether, but **when**. The latest data shows that the answer to the _when_ question is increasingly apparent.

When 70% of smartphone users talk, will you be ready to listen?

[Voicebot.ai](https://voicebot.ai) (a proven source of AI-voice commentary and research) published the results of their [January 2019 quantitative survey of US voice assistant adoption and usage](https://voicebot.ai/smart-speaker-consumer-adoption-report-2019/) – on both smart speakers and smart phones. Here are the takeaways retailers need to know.

## Put your ear to the ground in voice assistance adoption

* 

66.4 million US adults now own smart speakers. That’s more than 26% of the US adult population and a year-on-year increase of 40.3%.

* 70.2% of all US smartphone users – that’s roughly 153 million people – used a voice assistant in 2018. It’s estimated that more than 30 million did so for first time. Year-on-year growth: 23%.

## And while you’re there, listen to the growing sound of commerce

* In the smart speaker space, monthly shopping usage using AI-voice – in activities ranging from search to transaction – grew from 13.6% of owners to 19% overall.
* 28% of owners – a nice cohort of some 18.6 million highly digital, higher income Americans – searched for products via voice on a monthly basis.
* 26% of owners – a nice cohort of some 17.2 million highly digital, higher income Americans – used voice assistants on a monthly basis to find recipes or ask for cooking instructions.  
* And, 15% of owners – a small, but leading-edge cohort of 10 million Americans – uses voice assistants on a monthly basis to make a purchase.

More than 30% of [smart speaker](https://voicebot.ai/2019/08/12/marketers-view-voice-assistant-presence-on-smartphones-more-important-than-on-smart-speakers/) owners would like to use their speakers to get answers from customer service departments – and another 30% are open to the idea. That’s a why-can’t-we-get-the-answer-we-want-when-we-want-it cohort of about 40 million US consumers.

From here, that sounds like a meaningful value opportunity for retailers and CPG’s. AI-voice in commerce. Can you hear it coming?

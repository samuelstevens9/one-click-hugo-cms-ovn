Today’s voice-assistance environment is similar to the early, pre-standards days of the internet—the era of the so-called browser wars. 

It's a bit of a sonic wild, wild west. There is no recognized registry of destination or dispatch names, no assured way for consumers to find companies or brands. There are no standards for identification and authentication in a multi-platform world, no set of widely-used voice commands for common commerce processes. There are no standards, nor commonly-developed and -adopted ethical use guidelines on the topics of personal and commercial data use and privacy, of protection of minors.  

Broadly speaking, there is today no “rule of law” for voice technology users—be they consumers, enterprises, or developers.

In such an environment, two things generally happen:

* **Consumers will hesitate to try new, higher-value usage behaviors**—and _especially outside the walled gardens of proprietary platforms._ Why? A lack of trust as to how things and systems work, how the rules (if any) apply, how identity and data are protected.   
  \
  At the 2020 Voice@CES Summit in Las Vegas, Edison Research SVP Tom Webster spoke to this very topic, noting that the barrier to higher-value consumer use was not technological, but trust—especially consumer trust about data privacy.\
   ~
* **In time, some form of governance will appear**, as it does whenever people, ideas, and value collide.  Standards will begin to emerge. But the question—now and tomorrow, and across the universe of voice users—is this: _who, or what, will develop and impose the standards, and for whose benefit?_

**The issue of consumer trust** is a major reason for consumer-facing industries and their brands to invest in the development of standards for voice assistance.

In voice (as with other new technologies), the creation of consumer trust will start with the establishment of a “rule of law” built on standards, usage guidelines, even user-informed regulations. These will assure users of common, easy-to-learn processes, of destination access, of respect for privacy and data use. And whether the user is a consumer, a brand marketer, or a conversational AI developer.

Such a “rule of law” will also (to the benefit of consumers and brands) help distinguish the good actors from the bad. As such, it will give additional reasons for a consumer to place trust in a brand and a company, to try and embrace new capabilities, and to willingly share the data that will be so important to mutual value creation.

All which will grow the value and size of this market.

All these and more are the reasons why there is now a critical need for leaders across consumer-facing industries—business users and developers alike—to join together and develop the standards and usage guidelines that will lead this transformative technology into its future.

Standards that will encourage use and growth. Standards that will enable competitive differentiation.   

Standards for the many. Standards that will give everyone their voice.

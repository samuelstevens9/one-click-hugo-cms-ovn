The Open Voice Network—the non-profit industry association that will bring the value of standards to the world of voice assistance—looks forward to hearing you this January!

We'll be in New York for the annual [National Retail Federation](https://nrf.com/) Big Show. If you're working in voice in retail, please stop by our Open Voice Network voice developers meet-up, **Saturday, January 11th**, from **1:00 - 3:00 p.m.**, at the **Javits Center**. We'll be on Level 3, just outside the entrance to Halls 3B and 3D. Look for the logo!

Please join us the morning of Wednesday, January 15th, for our important **2020 Update Meeting,** **9:00 - 10:30 a.m. at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, 40th floor**. If you would like to attend this event, please RSVP to [jon.stine@openvoicenetwork.org](jon.stine@openvoicenetwork.org), so we can ensure you're on the ground floor security clearance list.

Of course, we'll be walking the Expo floor on Monday and Tuesday during the Big Show. We would love to connect with conversational AI seers, strategists, and developers. To schedule an appointment, please reach out to [jon.stine@openvoicenetwork.org](jon.stine@openvoicenetwork.org).

We'll be in Chattanooga on January 16-17th for the exciting [Project Voice Conference](https://www.projectvoice.ai/)—and for the opportunity to meet with the members and leaders of the [VoiceFirst Community](https://www.voicefirst.community/).

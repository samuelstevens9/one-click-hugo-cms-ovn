  If you don't trust it, you won't use it. Other than for the simplest of

Back in February, eMarketer released a study on the state of smart speaker conversational commerce.

Their headline: "[Purchases via Smart Speakers Are Not Taking Off.](https://www.emarketer.com/content/purchases-via-smart-speakers-are-not-taking-off)"

A pin-prick on the optimism of voice enthusiasts?

Not so fast, my friends. More a signal of what we, as an industry, must do. (And yes, I'm talking about standards.)

Two important takeaways:

1. If you delve into the details, you'll find that that purchase activity via smart speakers is _**actually growing,**_ and will pass an important milestone in 2020: more than 10 percent of all digital buyers will make a purchase using a smart speaker.
2. What's slowing growth? In the eyes of the experts, it's all about a **lack of consumer trust.**

Let's quote eMarketer:

## _"A key reason for the revised forecast is that device-makers haven't fully gained users trust. Potential buyers are still concerned about it when it comes to secure payments and privacy."_

Hmmm.

This echoes the good thoughts from Edison Research's David Webster at January's Voice@CES, that a lack of consumer trust will inhibit more advanced voice usage.

It also gives additional credence to [the plans](https://openvoicenetwork.org/about/) of the Open Voice Network, which is working to bring the consumer confidence brought by standards to the world of voice assistance.

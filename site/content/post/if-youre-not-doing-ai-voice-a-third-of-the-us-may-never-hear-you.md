Quoting Victoria Petrock, eMarketer, August 2019, "Voice Assistant Use Reaches Critical Mass."

## "Voice-control technology has officially moved out of the early-adopter phase and into the mainstream."

"We estimate that 111.8 million people in the US will use a voice assistant at least monthly this year, up 9.5% from 102.0 million  in 2018. This amounts to 39.4% of US internet users and 33.8% of the overall population."

"By 2021, the number of US voice assistant users will reach 122.7 million, representing 42.2% of US internet users and 36.6% of the US population..."

"Voice assistant use also cuts across various demographics. For example, there will be 57.6 million female and 54.2 million male voice assistant users in the US this year..."

"Today, most people use their voice assistants on smartphones and smart speakers. Smartphones, by a wide margin, are most common. This is not surprising, given the sheer numbers."

## "The US penetration rate for smartphones is 70.5%, and most models now come equipped with—or can download—voice assistant software."

\~\~\~\~

These numbers are staggering, and it's just the beginning. Where will brands go from here? How many voice assistants will be present by 2025? There is one thing we know for sure: voice is here to stay.

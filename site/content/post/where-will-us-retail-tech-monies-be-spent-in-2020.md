We recently had the pleasure of reading Total Retail’s [valuable analysis](https://mytotalretail.tradepub.com/free/w_totb14/) of US retail technology trends, buying behaviors, and future purchasing intentions. Thought-provoking. 

The headline—and no surprise—was this: for 2019 and 2020, it’s all about omnichannel fulfillment. That’s where discretionary monies were spent in 2019, and that’s where investments will continue to increase in 2020 and beyond. It’s inventory and order management systems, and order fulfillment and scheduling software. All aimed at delivering the customer-centric, unified commerce capabilities that are now the starting point for retail success.

With the COVID-19 pandemic still at the forefront of current business, it's no surprise that some of this direction has become skewed. However, businesses are already beginning to refocus their sights on this topic as restrictions lift and consumers return to the wild.

For the rest of 2020 and beyond, the topics will gravitate towards content management, personalization, and marketing automation. Of course—because it's rough out there. [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/546894/number-of-amazon-prime-paying-members/) tells us that there were roughly 105 million Amazon Prime members in the US as of June 2019. The research firm[ eMarketer](https://www.emarketer.com/content/more-product-searches-start-on-amazon) tells us that nearly 47 percent of all US online product searches begin on Amazon.com. Is anyone confused why shopper retention and acquisition deserves additional investment?

What's also very interesting are the details on pre-COVID and anticipated spending on emerging technology. More than one-third of the survey respondents denoted they would not be allocating budget in 2020 to any of the emerging technologies listed by Total Retail. **And that’s a list that includes artificial intelligence.** Hmm.

But for those who do plan to invest new monies in the future, **the top-four list of new emerging technology investment** in 2020 is striking.

**Artificial intelligence is number one. And should be. AI is followed in order by _chatbots_, visual search, and _voice search_ and commerce.**

The latter three all rated as more important and valuable going forward than such tools of past promise as RFID, IOT, robots, virtual reality, beacons, and drones.

Why chatbots and voice?  Four big reasons.

* Because the regular use of voice assistance is now a regular part of more than one-third of the US’s internet users. Voice availability and adoption is accelerating at a double-digit CAGR—[Juniper Research](https://www.juniperresearch.com/press/press-releases/digital-voice-assistants-in-use-to-8-million-2023) predicts 8 billion voice assistants worldwide by 2023.
* Because these two emerging technologies are becoming a critical, every-day connection point between shoppers and brands. Especially for omnichannel retail. _What's easier than saying yes from the kitchen or from your smartphone?_ __
* Because they create ease and convenience for shoppers at a time when the killer value proposition is all about ease and convenience.
* Because they have the potential—potential being realized by early adopters—of creating lasting, emotion-based bonds between shoppers and brands.

All these and more are the reasons why leading retailers and CPG brands are now investing in voice search and commerce.

**And why we're now creating the Open Voice Network.  An enterprise-driven, non-profit industry association, business-smart and platform neutral, bringing the value of standards to voice assistance.**
